In the 'GORICA_in_SEM' github repository (https://github.com/rebeccakuiper/GORICA_in_SEM), 
you can find the files that belong to the article:

Kuiper, R. (2021). AIC-type Theory-Based Model Selection for Structural Equation Models. Structural Equation Modeling, 29(1), 151-158. 
https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2020.1836967


In the meantime, the R package restriktor has been changed, 
meaning that the code to run the examples changed.

The files based on the newest restriktor version can be found on
the 'GORICA in SEM' subfolder of the 'Tutorials' github repository:
https://github.com/rebeccakuiper/Tutorials/tree/main/GORICA%20in%20SEM
