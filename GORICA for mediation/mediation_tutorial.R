# Simulate a simple mediation model
sim_model <- "X =~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5
              Y =~ Y1 + Y2 + Y3 + Y4 + Y5
              M =~ M1 + M2 + M3 + M4 + M5
              M ~ .3*X
              Y ~ .5*M
              Y ~ .3*X"
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
sim_data <- lavaan::simulateData(sim_model)

# Specify (a blind) model
model <- "X =~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5
          Y =~ Y1 + Y2 + Y3 + Y4 + Y5
          M =~ M1 + M2 + M3 + M4 + M5

          Y ~ b*M
          Y ~ c*X
          indirect := a*b
          direct := c"

# Fit the model
fit <- lavaan::sem(model, sim_data)

# See the results
summary(fit, std = T)


# Extract standardized estimates of the defined parameters and their var-cov matrix 
# which parameters are needed
label_names <- c("direct", "indirect")
indices <- which(standardizedSolution(fit)[, 'label'] %in% label_names)
# Extract them
est <- standardizedSolution(fit)[indices, 'est.std'] # defined parameters' estimates
VCOV <- lavInspect(fit, "vcov.def.std.all")[label_names, label_names] # VCOV matrix of parameters
# Label estimates - here, use labels from VCOV.
# Note: if own labels, possibly rename or remove labels VCOV
names(est) <- colnames(VCOV) # label_names


# Now, let's evaluate various mediation hypotheses

# 1. Is there an arbitrarily small indirect effect?
# Recall the concept of SESOI (smallest effect size of interest)

H_any <- "abs(indirect) > 0.05"
# vs its compliment

set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
gorica_indirect <- restriktor::goric(est, VCOV = VCOV,
                                  hypotheses = list(H_any = H_any))
gorica_indirect

# Here, we evaluate support for the presence of 
# an indirect effect of a given (non-negligible) magnitude in any direction.


# 2. Is there partial mediation?

H_part <- "abs(indirect) > 0.05; abs(direct) > 0.05"
# vs its compliment

set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
restriktor::goric(est, VCOV = VCOV,
                  hypotheses = list(H_part = H_part))

# Here, we evaluate support for the presence of 
# partial mediation of a given magnitude in any direction.
# In other words, we evaluate whether both the direct and the indirect effect 
# of a non-negligible size (in any direction) are present.


# 3. Is there full mediation?

#H_full <- "abs(indirect) > 0.05; abs(direct) < 0.05"
## vs its compliment
#
# Probably better because of approximate equality for direct effect:
H_full <- "abs(indirect) > 0.05; -0.05 < direct < 0.05"
# vs its compliment

set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
restriktor::goric(est, VCOV = VCOV,
                  hypotheses = list(H_full = H_full))

# Here, we evaluate support for the presence of 
# full mediation of any magnitude and direction.
# Namely, we evaluate whether a meaningful indirect effect is present 
# while the direct is, at most, negligible.


# 2. & 3. Partial vs Full mediation

H_part <- "abs(indirect) > 0.05; abs(direct) > 0.05"
#H_full <- "abs(indirect) > 0.05; abs(direct) < 0.05"
H_full <- "abs(indirect) > 0.05; -0.05 < direct < 0.05"
# and unconstrained as failsafe

# In case you want to select the best fitting mediation type, 
# you can compare both hypotheses with the unconstrained 
# to make sure none of them is weak.

set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
restriktor::goric(est, VCOV = VCOV,
                  hypotheses = list(H_part = H_part, 
                                    H_full = H_full))

# Second, you can compare the best hypothesis against its complement.
restriktor::goric(est, VCOV = VCOV,
                  hypotheses = list(H_part = H_part))


# 4. Directional hypothesis

# You can also specify any effect's direction.

#H_full_pos <- "indirect > 0.05; abs(direct) < 0.05"
H_full_pos <- "indirect > 0.05; -0.05 < direct < 0.05"
# vs its compliment

set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
restriktor::goric(est, VCOV = VCOV,
                  hypotheses = list(H_full_pos = H_full_pos))
