you can find the files that belong to the article:

Snijders, I., Wijnia, L., Kuiper, R. M., Rikers, R. M. J. P., & Loyens, S. M. M. (2021). Relationship quality in higher education and the interplay with student engagement and loyalty. British Journal of Educational Psychology, 92(2), 425-446.

- the RI-CLPM example uses data from: https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/lavaan.html


In the meantime, the R package restriktor has been changed, 
meaning that the code to run the examples changed.

An updated example based on the newest restriktor version can be found on
the 'GORICA in RI-CLPM' subfolder of the 'Tutorials' github repository:
https://github.com/rebeccakuiper/Tutorials/tree/main/GORICA%20in%20RI-CLPM



How to download files from a github repository:
