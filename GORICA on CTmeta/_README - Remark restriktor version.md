In the 'GORICA_on_CTmeta' github repository (https://github.com/rebeccakuiper/GORICA_on_CTmeta), 
you can find the files that belong to the article:

Kuiper, R. (2021). Evaluating Causal Dominance of CTmeta-Analyzed Lagged Regression Estimates. Structural Equation Modeling, 28(6), 951-963. 
https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2020.1823228


In the meantime, the R package restriktor has been changed, 
meaning that the code to run the examples (and simulations) changed.

The example files based on the newest restriktor version can be found on
the 'GORICA on CTmeta' subfolder of the 'Tutorials' github repository:
https://github.com/rebeccakuiper/Tutorials/tree/main/GORICA%20on%20CTmeta



How to download files from a github repository:

1. Click on green button called Code.
2. Download zip (last option in list).
3. Unzip it on your machine (that folder is now your working directory).
